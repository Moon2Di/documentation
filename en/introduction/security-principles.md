# Emercoin Security Principles

Inheriting all the security advantages of bitcoin, Emercoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate without a centralized
authority. Transaction verification and currency issuance is carried out
collectively by the network through consensus. All records are
completely decentralized and uncensorable and cannot be altered, revoked
or suspended by any authority.

While blockchains are <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_design">secure by
design</a>, the possibility
of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=51+percent+attack">51% attacks</a>
exist where an entity controls more than half of the network hashing
power.

But with PoW and PoS working in tandem, the Emercoin blockchain
possesses an enhanced degree of security. A 51% attack on Emercoin would
require someone having both a minimum of 51% of the network hashpower
and at least 51% of the total coin supply in their possession. Such an
attack on the Emercoin blockchain would be a self destructive move by
the attacker since they would simultaneously be damaging the network and
devaluing their own massive coin holdings.

Now that Emercoin is [merge-mined](/en/block-generation/proof-of-work-mining.md) with
Bitcoin, it benefits from a significant portion of the mining power of
the Bitcoin network.

Technically a 51% attack on Emercoin would have been possible before
merge-mining began but it would have been a fruitless move that required
spending a large sum of money to perform, and only someone with several
million dollars to waste and a serious grudge against the Emer
blockchain would have had the means to do it.

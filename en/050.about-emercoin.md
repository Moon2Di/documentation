Emercoin is a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) platform supporting a wide range of distributed trusted services. Distinctive features include high reliability, robustness and 3-in-one hybrid mining (PoW+MergedMining+PoS). Currently, the Emercoin platform already runs the network security services
[EmerSSL](../300.blockchain-services/200.emerssl/050.emerssl-introduction.md)/[EmerSSH](../300.blockchain-services/emerssh.md), decentralized
domain system [EmerDNS](../300.blockchain-services/250.emerdns/050.emerdns-introduction.md), an anti-counterfeit solution
[EmerDPO](../300.blockchain-services/300.emerdpo/050.emerdpo-introduction.md), VOIP solution [ENUMER](../300.blockchain-services/450.enumer.md), as well as several other [bundled blockchain services](../300.blockchain-services/050.introduction-to-emercoin-services.md). At the heart of many of these innovations is the [Emercoin NVS](../300.blockchain-services/100.emernvs.md) which allows for the arbitrary storage of **name-&gt;value** pairs on the blockchain.

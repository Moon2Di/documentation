Emercoin is a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> platform supporting a wide range of distributed trusted services. Distinctive features include high reliability, robustness and 3-in-one hybrid mining (PoW+MergedMining+PoS). Currently, the Emercoin platform already runs the network security services
[EmerSSL](/en/blockchain-services/emerssl/emerssl-introduction.md)/[EmerSSH](/en/blockchain-services/emerssh.md), decentralized
domain system [EmerDNS](/en/blockchain-services/emerdns/emerdns-introduction.md), an anti-counterfeit solution
[EmerDPO](/en/blockchain-services/emerdpo/emerdpo-introduction.md), VOIP solution [ENUMER](/en/blockchain-services/enumer.md), as well as several other [bundled blockchain services](/en/blockchain-services/introduction-to-emercoin-services.md). At the heart of many of these innovations is the [Emercoin NVS](/en/blockchain-services/emernvs.md) which allows for the arbitrary storage of **name-&gt;value** pairs on the blockchain.

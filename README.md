# Emercoin Community Documentation Project

This repository contains the pages that generate the Emercoin Community Documentation found at <https://emercoin.com/documentation/>.

<!--
## Community additions are welcome!

If you want to add to the Emercoin Documentation, please keep in mind the following:

* Documentation is written using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. 
* File and folder structure should be compatible with [daux.io](https://dauxio.github.io/), which is used to generate the pages (e.g. see <https://dauxio.github.io> which is generated from [this](https://github.com/dauxio/daux.io/blob/master/docs>) repository).
* When your Pull-Request is accepted on GitHub, the pages at <https://docs.emercoin.com> will be automatically updated to reflect the changes made.
* If errors prevent the pages being generated (e.g. a link to a missing file), they can be discovered at <https://docs.emercoin.com/log.txt>
